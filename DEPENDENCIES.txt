This has been built assuming an Ubuntu 10.04LTS base system with the following
packages installed: 

php5
libapache2-mod-php5
apache2
putty-tools

Whilst not a dependancy, it is best to have the /var/www directory owned by the www-data:www-data user:group.
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
can be used to achieve this.

It is advised that /var/www/phpca be the root folder for your phpca website and /var/www/certstore be your folder location for the certificates. That way, www-data can write to the certstore, without it being directly accessible via the webserver, but only via php code accessible via /var/www/phpca
